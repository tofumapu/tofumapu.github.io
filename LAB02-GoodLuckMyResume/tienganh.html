        <p style="color:red; background-color: aliceblue;">English is not just a language but a gateway to a new world
            of vast knowledge, international communication,
            and global career opportunities. With each new vocabulary and grammar rule, I embark on a journey of
            exploring language and culture. <br></p>
        <p style="background-color: antiquewhite;">My experience in learning English started with basic classes in
            elementary school and progressed through
            higher-level education in middle and high school. By participating in courses, reading books, and regularly
            interacting with the English-speaking community, I have developed confident skills in listening, speaking,
            reading, and writing. <br></p>
        <p style="background-color: aquamarine;">One of my most crucial experiences was joining cultural exchange and
            study programs in English-speaking
            countries. Daily communication with native speakers not only improved my communication skills but also
            served as the best way to deeply understand local culture and lifestyles<br></p>
        <p style="background-color: azure;">My English proficiency is assessed through international certificates such
            as TOEFL and IELTS. Additionally,
            I frequently enroll in online courses to enhance my knowledge of language usage and application in a work
            environment.</p>
        <p style="background-color: beige;">I believe that continuous learning and challenging oneself are the keys to
            developing English proficiency. I
            am always enthusiastic about discovering new vocabulary, complex grammar, and creative expressions in
            English. Through each lesson and every interaction, I aspire to become a proficient and effective user of
            English in both personal and professional communication.</p>
